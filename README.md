# Ti-84-Highschool-Programs
This is a compilation of 12 different algebra related programs I used in highschool on my ti-84 calculator. It will probably be updated.


Main Branch: for color calculators only.
Secondary Branch: for non-color calculators only.
The color calculators have different pixel density and relative screensize compared to the standard non-color versions.

Please comment any problems you have.
