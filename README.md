# Ti-84-Highschool-Programs
This is a compilation of 12 different algebra related programs I used in highschool on my ti-84 calculator. It will probably be updated.


Algebra CE: for color calculators only.
Algebra Non-CE: for non-color calculators only.
The color calculators have different pixel density and relative screensize compared to the standard non-color versions.

Please comment any problems you have.


You should not have to use the Asm( function to run the program. Just transfer the respective file to your calculator and it should run fine.
